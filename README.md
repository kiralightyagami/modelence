## 🚀 About Modelence

Modelence is a complete toolkit for building and running production-ready AI agents. Our platform eliminates the complexity of setting up AI infrastructure, allowing you to focus on building amazing AI applications.

### 🎯 Built for Modern AI Apps

Whether you're building chatbots, AI assistants, or complex agentic workflows, Modelence provides everything you need out of the box.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🤖 **LLM Integration**
Effortlessly connect to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini and other models with built-in API key management.

### 📊 **AI Observability**
Get instant visibility into every LLM and AI agent action with automatic tracing, error tracking, and real-time metrics.

### 🔄 **Agentic Workflows**
Build persistent, stateful AI agents with built-in cron jobs, background workers, and a modular system for scheduling at scale.

### ⏰ **Cron Jobs**
Simply define a handler function and it will run at your specified time interval, with sub-second precision and cron job orchestration for multiple application instances.

### 📡 **Data Loading**
Define queries and mutations to send and retrieve data between the client and server. Use React hooks on the client to fetch data, handle errors and loading state with a single statement.

### 📈 **Telemetry**
All cron jobs and method calls are automatically logged and traced, so you can see full insights in your application's performance dashboard in Modelence Cloud.
